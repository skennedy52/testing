# testing
general testing and other stuff

This is a "code challenge" assignment developed in Visual Studio Code.
Due to several technical issues some of the project files don't compile or run, and some of the packages/resources will not load.
However, this should give some idea of my level of experience. One area that I'm working on is learning API/REST services.
